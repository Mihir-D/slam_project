## Abstract:

This project implements the Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) using the ROS
package rtabmap. The paper discusses the concept of graph slam, the features of rtabmap and how
the rtabmap package was used to generate the map of the environment. Furthermore, the paper
describes how to create an environment in gazebo. The difficulties in using rtabmap, the mapping
results of the provided environment and the newly created environment are explained. In the end,
various possible applications of rtabmap for SLAM are discussed.
